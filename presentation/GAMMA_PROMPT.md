SLIDE 2 - THE PROBLEM
Title: Pakistan's Agricultural Crisis

Key Statistics (use large, bold numbers):
- 42% of Pakistan's workforce depends on agriculture
- 30% crop losses annually due to poor monitoring
- $3.5 billion economic impact from preventable losses
- 85% of farmers lack access to precision agriculture tools
- Only 15% of farmers own smartphones with data plans

Pain Points (3 cards):
1. 🌾 Late Disease Detection - Farmers discover crop diseases too late
2. 💧 Water Mismanagement - Inefficient irrigation wastes 40% of water
3. 📊 No Predictive Data - Decisions based on guesswork, not science
